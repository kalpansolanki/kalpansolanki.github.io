## Acknowledgements
This project was developed under the MYOSA initiative with guidance and support from mentors, faculty members, and peers who encouraged iterative design, testing, and responsible system development.

---

## Overview
MyOSA LifeSaver is a modular embedded systems prototype built to explore how sensing, motion control, and real-time feedback can work together in CPR assistance system engineering.

The project is designed as a learning and experimentation platform, bringing together hardware, firmware, and mechanical design in a clear and responsible way. Rather than focusing on clinical outcomes, it emphasizes transparency, predictability, and hands-on understanding of system behavior during controlled operation.

### Purpose
This prototype was created to help students and researchers understand the fundamental building blocks of CPR assistance systems. It enables observation and experimentation with motion cycles, sensor feedback, and embedded control logic in a safe and structured manner.

### Non-Clinical Note
This project is strictly intended for educational, experimental, and demonstration purposes only and is **not** a medical or clinical device.

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Modular System Architecture
The system follows a modular design approach, allowing individual components such as sensing, actuation, and display to be understood, modified, and extended independently.

### 2. Sensor-Based Monitoring
Multiple sensors monitor orientation, pressure, and interaction parameters, enabling real-time observation of system behavior during operation.

### 3. Controlled Motor-Driven Motion
A motor-driven actuation mechanism performs repeatable motion cycles inspired by CPR compression patterns, intended purely for demonstration and experimentation.

### 4. On-Device Feedback Display
An OLED display provides live system information, allowing users to directly observe sensor readings, system status, and operational feedback.

### 5. Learning-Focused Design
The prototype prioritizes clarity, safety, and predictability, making it suitable for classroom demonstrations, workshops, and research exploration.

## Usage Instructions
1. Power the system using a regulated power source  
2. Allow all sensors to initialize during startup  
3. Observe live system information on the OLED display  
4. Run demonstrations using the predefined motor cycle  
5. Stop the system manually after testing is complete
