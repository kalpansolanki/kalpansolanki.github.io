> A non-clinical, hardware-based CPR assistance prototype designed for learning and experimentation.

## Acknowledgements
This project was developed under the MYOSA initiative with guidance and support from mentors, faculty members, and peers who encouraged iterative design, testing, and responsible system development.

## Overview
MyOSA LifeSaver is a modular embedded systems prototype created to explore how sensing, actuation, and real-time feedback can work together in CPR assistance system engineering.

The project is intentionally designed as a learning and experimentation platform. Instead of focusing on clinical outcomes, it emphasizes transparency, predictability, and hands-on understanding of how embedded systems behave during controlled operation. Hardware, firmware, and mechanical design are combined in a structured and accessible way to support academic learning.

### Purpose
The purpose of this prototype is to help students and researchers understand the fundamental building blocks of CPR assistance systems. It allows users to observe motion cycles, sensor behavior, and system coordination through direct experimentation and live feedback.

### Non-Clinical Note
This project is strictly intended for educational, experimental, and demonstration purposes only and is **not** a medical or clinical device.

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Modular System Architecture
The system follows a modular design approach, allowing sensing, actuation, display, and connectivity components to function as independent yet coordinated units. This makes the prototype easier to understand, test, and extend for academic purposes.

### 2. Multi-Sensor Feedback
The prototype integrates motion, pressure, and proximity sensors to capture real-time system state. These inputs provide insight into orientation, interaction, and environmental response during operation.

### 3. Controlled Actuation Logic
A motor-driven mechanism performs repeatable motion cycles inspired by CPR compression patterns. The focus is on consistency and predictability rather than medical accuracy.

### 4. Real-Time On-Device Feedback
An OLED display provides live feedback directly on the device, allowing users to observe sensor readings and system status without external tools.

### 5. Cloud-Based Data Logging
Sensor values are periodically transmitted to a cloud database, enabling remote observation and analysis of system behavior over time.

## Usage Instructions
1. Power the system using a regulated power source  
2. Allow all sensors to initialize during startup  
3. Observe live system information on the OLED display  
4. Run demonstrations using the predefined motion cycle  
5. Stop the system manually after testing is complete  

Below is a representative firmware snippet illustrating the sensing, display update, and cloud logging logic used in the prototype.
