## Overview

**SmartBio Air** is an intelligent indoor air purification and experimental research platform that combines algae-based biological air treatment with multi-sensor environmental monitoring and intelligent control.

The system follows a hybrid intelligence approach: safety-critical and time-sensitive operations are executed locally on the MYOSA Mini IoT Kit using Edge AI and threshold-based logic, while long-term data analysis and research-oriented insights are handled through cloud-based AI services.

This architecture ensures uninterrupted and safe operation during network outages while enabling extended scientific observation when connectivity is available. SmartBio Air functions both as a practical indoor air purifier and a research platform for studying the relationship between air quality, environmental conditions, and algae growth behavior.

**Key features:**

* Algae-based biological air purification
* Multi-sensor indoor air quality monitoring
* Edge AI–based safety and motor pump protection
* Dual offline and online operating modes
* Cloud-assisted research and long-term analysis
* Autonomous operation during network unavailability

## Features (Detailed)

### **1. Algae-Based Air Purification**

The system incorporates a living microalgae (*Spirulina*) chamber that biologically absorbs carbon dioxide and certain airborne pollutants while producing oxygen through photosynthesis.

### **2. Multi-Sensor Environmental Monitoring**

Multiple MQ-series gas sensors, environmental sensors, and light sensors continuously monitor indoor air quality, temperature, humidity, and pollution levels.

### **3. Edge AI Safety and Motor Protection**

Time-sensitive decisions such as air quality response and motor pump health classification are executed locally on the MYOSA Mini using on-device inference and predefined safety thresholds.

### **4. Dual Operating Modes**

- **Offline Edge Mode:** Fully autonomous operation prioritising air purification and hardware safety without internet connectivity.
- **Online Cloud Mode:** Sensor data is transmitted to the cloud for research-oriented analysis, correlation, and visualization.

### **5. Cloud-Assisted Research Platform**

Cloud AI services store and analyse long-term sensor data to study the relationship between air pollution levels, environmental conditions, and algae growth behaviour.
