# Features (Detailed) 

## 1.Intelligent Defect Detection & Classification
The system uses intelligent algorithms to continuously process real-time data collected from multiple onboard sensors, including track geometry sensors, vibration sensors, and rail condition sensors. These algorithms filter noise, extract meaningful parameters, and analyze patterns to accurately identify track defects at an early stage. Once a defect is detected, the system classifies it as either minor or major based on severity, risk level, and predefined safety thresholds. This early and accurate classification helps prevent small issues from developing into dangerous failures.

## 2. Real-Time Alerts & Dashboard Visualization
For major faults that pose a high safety risk, the system instantly generates alerts and sends them to railway maintenance teams along with accurate location details obtained through GPS and track mapping. At the same time, all sensor data and defect information are transmitted to a real-time web-based dashboard. This dashboard allows railway authorities to visualize current track conditions, monitor detected defects, and analyze historical data trends. By enabling predictive and preventive maintenance, the system supports data-driven decision-making and enhances long-term railway infrastructure reliability.

## 3. Scalable IoT-Enabled Railway Safety System
The system is designed as a scalable IoT-enabled railway safety solution using wireless communication and a modular architecture. Multiple autonomous inspection robots can be deployed across large railway networks, each continuously collecting and transmitting data to a centralized dashboard. This unified monitoring platform allows railway authorities to track real-time conditions, manage defects efficiently, and plan maintenance activities. The scalable design enables easy expansion by adding more robots, ensuring cost-effective, reliable, and efficient infrastructure management across extensive rail networks.

## 4. Autonomous defect detection, classification, and response system
The robot intelligently identifies track defects, distinguishes between minor and major issues, performs automatic on-site repairs for minor faults using a robotic arm, and instantly alerts maintenance teams with real-time dashboard visualization for major faults and predictive maintenance analysis.

# Usage Instructions
1. Place the robot on the track and power on the ESP32 and sensors.
2. Robot moves autonomously, collecting data with IR sensors, MPU6050, and GPS.
3. Live data is displayed on the dashboard with defect alerts and location.
4. Minor repairs (tightening bolts, welding cracks) are done automatically by the robotic arm.
5.  For major defects, the robot stops and sends an alert to authorities.

# Tech stack
## 1. MYOSA Motherboard – ESP32
The ESP32 MYOSA motherboard is the brain of your robot. It controls all the sensors and actuators, processes the data, and communicates with the dashboard via Wi-Fi. All other components connect to it, making it the central control unit.

## 2. Sensors
**Gyroscope**  
The gyroscope detects the robot’s rotation or tilt. It helps the robot know which direction it is turning or if it is leaning, which is important for balance and navigation on tracks.  

**Accelerometer**  
The accelerometer measures the robot’s acceleration and movement. It tells the ESP32 how fast the robot is moving or if it suddenly stops, which can help detect shocks or collisions.  

**Temperature Sensor**  
The temperature sensor measures the environment or motor temperature. It can alert if the robot or motors are overheating to prevent damage.  

**Pressure Sensor**  
The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure. This is useful for detecting weather conditions or elevation changes in the track area.  

**Altitude Sensor**  
The altitude sensor calculates the robot’s height above sea level. Combined with the pressure sensor, it helps track elevation changes in the railway tracks.  

## 3. Display – OLED
The OLED display is a small screen connected to the ESP32. It shows real-time data like sensor readings (temperature, pressure, GPS location) or robot status, allowing quick monitoring without a computer.

## 4. How They Work Together
All these MYOSA sensors send data to the ESP32 motherboard:  
- Gyroscope + accelerometer help with movement and tilt detection.  
- Temperature ensures the robot doesn’t overheat.  
- Pressure + altitude track environmental conditions and height.  
- The OLED display shows this data in real-time.  
The ESP32 can also send all this information over Wi-Fi to a dashboard for live monitoring.

## 3. Motors and Servo
**Servo Motor (MYOSA Component):** A small motor controlled by the ESP32 with PWM signals. It does precise movements, like pushing switches, controlling small mechanical parts, or making adjustments on the track.  

**12V DC Motor + Motor Driver:** This is the main motor that moves the robot. The motor driver protects the ESP32 from high current and allows control over speed and direction.

## 4. Power Supply
The robot uses separate power lines:  
- ESP32 & sensors: 3.3V–5V  
- DC Motor: 12V  
This separation ensures safety and prevents the microcontroller from being damaged by the motor’s high power.

## 5. Software
The robot is programmed using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO. MYOSA components have libraries and functions that make coding easy:  
- Servo.h for servo control  
- TinyGPS++ for GPS data  
- PWM control for DC motor  
- Reading IR sensors with digitalRead() or interrupts  
- Sending data to a web dashboard

## 6. Communication
The ESP32 can send live data to a dashboard using Wi-Fi. This allows you to monitor:  
- The robot’s location (GPS)  
- Obstacle detection (IR sensors)  
- Motor and servo actions  
Protocols like HTTP or MQTT help the ESP32 communicate with the dashboard.

## 7. Dashboard
The dashboard shows real-time robot status:  
- Frontend: Built with React.js or Next.js  
- Backend: Node.js, Flask, or Firebase to store and process data  
- Map: GPS location displayed with Google Maps API or Leaflet.js
