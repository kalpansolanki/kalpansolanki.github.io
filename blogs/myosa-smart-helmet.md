## Overview
Concussions are a major concern in contact sports, often going undetected until severe symptoms arise. The **Smart Helmet Concussion Monitor** is an IoT-based solution designed to track head impacts in real-time.

Using an **ESP32** microcontroller and an **MPU6050** accelerometer/gyroscope, the system measures both linear acceleration ($g$) and rotational acceleration ($rad/s^2$). It applies the **Rowson et al. Concussion Probability (CP)** formula to estimate the risk of injury for every impact. Data is streamed over **Wi-Fi** to a laptop, where a Python application provides live visualization and data logging capabilities.

**Key features:**
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks linear and rotational acceleration at high speed.
*   **Concussion Probability (CP):** Instantly calculates injury risk using valid biomechanical models.
*   **Wireless Streaming:** Uses ESP32 SoftAP mode to stream data to a PC via TCP.
*   **Live Dashboard:** Python-based GUI for visualizing impact data and CP spikes.
*   **Data Export:** Saves session data to Excel/CSV for medical or performance analysis.

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Dual-Axis Impact Sensing
The system reads raw data from the MPU6050 sensor to calculate:
- **Linear Acceleration:** Magnitude of acceleration in $g$.
- **Rotational Acceleration:** Derived from gyroscope angular velocity, measured in $rad/s^2$.
This ensures a comprehensive view of the forces acting on the head, not just simple impacts.

### 2. Embedded CP Calculation
The ESP32 processes sensor data locally to calculate the Combined Probability of Concussion (CP) using the formula:
$$CP = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 a_{linear} + \beta_2 \alpha_{rotational})}}$$
This allows for immediate risk assessment without needing cloud processing.

### 3. Wi-Fi Direct Streaming
To ensure reliability in the field, the helmet creates its own Wi-Fi network (`MYOSA-HELMET-AP`). The Python client connects directly to this network, ensuring low-latency data transmission without needing an external router.

### 4. Data Visualization & Logging
A custom Python tool (`plot_wifi.py`) connects to the helmet, plotting live graphs of:
- Linear Acceleration ($g$)
- Rotational Acceleration ($rad/s^2$)
- Concussion Probability (%)

Users can click **"Save Excel"** to export the current session's data for further analysis.

## Usage Instructions

### Setting up the Helmet
1.  Power on the ESP32 (via battery bank).
2.  Wait for the Wi-Fi network **`MYOSA-HELMET-AP`** to appear.
3.  Connect your laptop to this network.

### Running the Dashboard
Run the Python script to start receiving data:

```plaintext
python tools/plot_wifi.py
```

The dashboard will open, displaying live sensor data. Perform impacts or movements to see the graphs update. Press **"Save Excel"** to save the recorded data.
