## Overview

**SafeSite** is a comprehensive IoT-based worker safety monitoring system specifically designed for **factory and manufacturing environments**. The system uses the MYOSA platform's ESP32 controller and multiple sensors to continuously monitor factory floor workers' conditions and environmental factors in real-time.

In busy factory settings, workers operate heavy machinery, work near hazardous equipment, and navigate complex production floors. **SafeSite** addresses critical safety challenges by providing:

- **Real-time monitoring** of worker movement and orientation
- **Instant emergency communication** via panic button
- **Centralized oversight** for floor supervisors and safety managers
- **Environmental awareness** through temperature and pressure monitoring

**What problem does it solve?**

- Delayed response to factory floor emergencies and accidents
- Lack of real-time visibility into worker conditions on the production floor
- No centralized monitoring system for multiple factory workers
- Poor communication between floor workers and safety supervisors
- Difficulty detecting worker falls or unusual movements near machinery

**Who is it for?**

- Factory floor supervisors
- Manufacturing plant safety managers
- Production line coordinators
- Industrial safety officers
- Quality control managers
- Any manufacturing facility with workers in potentially hazardous areas

**Key Features:**

- Real-time sensor data streaming (accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, pressure, light)
- Panic button for emergency alerts
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring multiple workers
- Bidirectional communication (admin can send alerts to workers)
- Motion detection with tilt angle monitoring
- Audio and visual alert notifications
- Worker status tracking (online/offline detection)
- Data logging and export functionality

## Features (Detailed)

### **1. Real-Time Sensor Monitoring**

The system continuously reads data from multiple MYOSA sensors and streams it to the dashboard via MQTT protocol.

**Sensors Used:**

- **Accelerometer & Gyroscope (MPU6050)**: Detects motion, orientation, and potential falls
- **Barometric Pressure Sensor (BMP280)**: Measures atmospheric pressure and estimates altitude
- **Light & Proximity Sensor (APDS-9960)**: Monitors ambient light levels and proximity
- **Temperature Sensor**: Built into the motion sensor for body/environment temperature

**Data Processing:**

- 10-sample moving average filter for smooth readings
- 500ms publish interval for real-time updates
- Automatic reconnection on network failure

### **2. Panic Button Emergency Alert**

Workers can trigger an immediate emergency alert by pressing a physical panic button connected to GPIO 33.

**How it works:**

1. Worker presses panic button
2. ESP32 detects button press with debounce logic
3. Alert is published to MQTT topic
4. Dashboard receives alert instantly
5. Audio alarm plays on admin's computer
6. Visual notification appears with worker details
7. OLED displays "PANIC ALERT SENT" confirmation

**Alert Data Includes:**

- Worker ID and name
- Alert type (panic)
- Severity level (critical)
- Timestamp
- Location (GPS ready for future)

### **3. Admin-to-Worker Communication**

Administrators can send alerts directly to workers from the dashboard.

**Features:**

- Send custom messages to specific workers
- Broadcast alerts to all workers simultaneously
- Adjustable severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Worker's buzzer activates on receiving alert
- Message displayed on worker's OLED screen

### **4. Worker Status Tracking**

The system automatically detects when hardware workers connect or disconnect.

**Status States:**

- **Online (Green)**: Worker device is connected and sending data
- **Offline (Gray)**: No data received for 15+ seconds
- **Alert (Red)**: Active emergency alert

**For Simulated Workers:**

- Always show as online when simulation is running
- Useful for testing and demonstration

### **5. Motion Detection & Tilt Monitoring**

Advanced motion analysis for safety monitoring.

**Capabilities:**

- Motion status (YES/NO) based on accelerometer activity
- Tilt angles (X, Y, Z) in degrees
- Gyroscope readings for rotation detection
- Potential fall detection (based on sudden acceleration changes)

### **6. Data Logging & Export**

All sensor data and alerts are stored in a SQLite database.

**Export Options:**

- Download all logs as JSON
- Export alerts as CSV
- Export sensor data as CSV
- Filter by date range or worker

### **7. Multi-Worker Dashboard**

Monitor multiple workers simultaneously from a single interface.

**Dashboard Features:**

- Worker cards with live status
- Click to view detailed sensor data
- Real-time charts (accelerometer, gyroscope)
- Alert history per worker
- Add new workers dynamically

## Usage Instructions

### **Starting the System**

**Step 1: Start Mosquitto MQTT Broker**

```bash
mosquitto -v
```

**Step 2: Start Backend Server**

```bash
cd safesite-dashboard/backend
npm install
node server.js
```

**Step 3: Start Frontend Development Server**

```bash
cd safesite-dashboard/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**Step 4: Upload Code to ESP32**

1. Open `code_safesite.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Update WiFi credentials:

```cpp
const char *ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char *password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
```

1. Update MQTT broker IP:

```cpp
const char *mqtt_server = "YOUR_PC_IP_ADDRESS";
```

1. Upload to ESP32

**Step 5: Access Dashboard**
Open browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

**Default Login:**

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### **Using the Panic Button**

Connect a push button between GPIO 33 and GND. The internal pull-up resistor is enabled automatically.

```
GPIO 33 ──── Button ──── GND
```

Press the button to send an emergency alert to the dashboard.

### **Sending Alerts from Dashboard**

1. Click on a worker card to open detail panel
2. Type a message in the alert input field
3. Click "Send Alert"
4. Worker's buzzer will sound and message appears on OLED
