## Overview
Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder, with high-load resistance training being a significant risk factor when performed with improper kinematics [1], [2], [3]. This project addresses a kinematic problem which is the inability of novice weightlifters to dissociate hip flexion (i.e., hinging at the pelvis) from lumbar flexion (i.e., rounding the lower spine) during exercises such as the deadlift and squat[14] and [15].

We propose the **Dual-IMU Smart Trainer** system that uses a differential sensing architecture to estimate relative lumbar flexion through mathematical subtraction of pelvic motion from thoracic motion[8],[10]. Unlike single-sensor devices [6] that only measure global trunk inclination, this system ensures feedback is only triggered by actual form breakdowns, not healthy hip hinge movements. The advantage of using dual IMUs is to improve measurement accuracy yet with minimal use of hardware

**Key features:**
* **Differential Sensing**: Employs two MPU6050 sensors strategically placed at the boundaries of lower back thoracolumbar (T12/L1) above and lumbosacral (L5/S1) junctions below.
* **Bilateral Haptic Feedback**: Immediate tactile cueing for wrong motion via vibration motors positioned over the erector (back) spinae muscles.
* **Robust Orientation Filter**: Combines complementary filtering and Zero-Velocity Update (ZUPT) algorithms to mitigate sensor drift.
* **Secure Mobile Integration**: Real-time data spine visualization as animated movement via Flutter app, with data secured using AES-CTR encryption over Bluetooth Low Energy.
* **Three-Zone Safety System**: flagiing motions as Green, Yellow, and Red zones based on biomechanical safe thresholds.

> **Technical Note on Visualization:** In the demonstration video, a slight forward inclination may be observed even when the user is stationary. This is due to the tracking mechanics used to draw the natural spine. Specifically, the lumbar sensor is positioned on a slightly more forward plane relative to the pelvic sensor due to clothing and textile belt limitations. While this affects the visual representation of the spine *leaning,* it does not impact the accuracy of the relative lumbar flexion angle calculations.

## Features (Detailed)

### 1. Differential Sensing & Relative Angle Calculation
The system derives the relative lumbar angle through quaternion-based kinematics using the formula:
```q_rel = q_sac^(-1) ⊗ q_thor``` [19]
By isolating the rotation around the pitch axis (sagittal plane), the system specifically detects flexion/extension ( The subject then extends the trunk backward to return to the upright posture ) while ignoring lateral rotation and bending movements. 
The pitch angle is extracted using:
``` θ_pitch = arcsin(2(q₀q₂ - q₃q₁)).```

### 2. Calibration and Zero-Velocity Update (ZUPT) algorithms
To eliminate zero-rate error, a blocking calibration routine averages 2000 samples at startup while the user remains stationary in an upright position. During operation, the Stance Hypothesis Optimal Detection (SHOE) [13] algorithm identifies stationary periods by computing a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test statistic that combines accelerometer variance and gyroscope energy. When stationary periods are detected, ZUPT are applied to maintain accuracy despite sensor drift[13].

### 3. Posture Classification
The system employs movement detection that classifies posture into three distinct cases:

* **Flexion**: detected when angle decreases rapidly (>2° per update, >60°/s). In a deadlift, this represents the **descending phase** or the initial hinging at the hips to reach down to the bar. If detected during the pull, it indicates "rounding" of the back.

* **Extension**: detected when angle increases rapidly. This signifies the **concentric pull** or the "lockout" phase. It tracks the athlete’s transition from a hinged position back to a vertical standing state as they drive the hips forward to complete the lift.


* **Upright**: when athlete posture is near zero angle (<4°) with minimal movement for 250ms. This represents the **setup or completion phase**. It monitors the athlete’s ability to maintain a neutral, vertical spine before the first rep or after the lockout, ensuring the lift begins and ends with proper spinal alignment.


This classification enables the system to distinguish between dynamic movement and stable postures, reducing false positives.

### 4. Threshold-Based Haptic Feedback

The system classifies posture into three zones based on biomechanically safe thresholds derived from research on competitive lifters. These thresholds specifically monitor the lower lumbar (lumbopelvic) region, where significant adjustments occur during heavy lifting.

* **Green (<20°): Safe Neutral Zone**[1], [14] This range represents the "neutral zone," where spinal load is equally distributed across tissues. Research shows experienced lifters maintain an average range of motion (ROM) of approximately 21.7° during a deadlift[15]. No feedback is provided.

* **Yellow (20°–30°): Warning Zone** This indicates the athlete is moving toward the outer range of their neutral posture, where loads begin to be unequally distributed[2]. Pulsed haptic feedback (200 ms intervals) alerts the athlete to re-stabilize the torso.

* **Red (>30°): Critical Zone**
 Exceeding 30° represents a significant deviation from neutral alignment, signaling that the torso is no longer in a braced, rigid position. Continuous haptic feedback provides an immediate signal to correct or abort the rep to prevent microtrauma.

### 5. Relative Flexibility and Dissociation

A key driver for exceeding these thresholds is **relative flexibility**, or the degree of dissociation between the hips and the lumbar spine movement. The body operates as a linked system where each segment influences the motion of adjacent segments.

If an athlete has relatively higher stiffness in the hip joints compared to the lumbar spine, the spine will more readily flex to achieve the required depth or reach the barbell. The haptic feedback serves as a real-time monitor for this lack of dissociation; when the hips reach their terminal range, any further movement is forced into the lumbar region, triggering a transition from the Green to the Yellow or Red zones. This cueing encourages the athlete to maintain a "back-dominant" or "hip-dominant" strategy that preserves spinal neutrality[12].

## Validation & Results

The system's performance was evaluated,in one subject, by comparing real-time sensor data against ground truth kinematics extracted via the computer vision-based **Kinovea biomechanical analysis software** [4]. This validation process was performed post-hoc, allowing for a detailed audit of the mathematical relationship between the firmware output and physical movement.

### 1. Post-Validation Error Discovery

During the validation phase, an analysis of the recorded test video revealed a consistent scaling discrepancy:

* **The Error:** The device reported angles at approximately **1/10th** of the actual physical displacement (e.g., a measured 27° flexion appearing as -2.7° in the telemetry).
* **What is the Cause?** This was identified as a unit-scaling issue within the Complementary Filter's integration step, likely caused by a mismatch between the hardcoded  (time step) and the actual loop frequency slowed by Serial/BLE overhead.
* **The Solution:** Using **Dynamic  calculation** to ensure future real-time accuracy.

### 2. Experimental Data Comparison

The following table maps the ground truth from Kinovea against the recorded telemetry from the app, for the tested subject. Because our **Upright Calibration** (ZUPT) treats the natural standing posture as the  reference, the "App Results" represent the relative deviation from that starting point.

| Movement Phase | Kinovea Ground Truth |Flexion Angle| App Telemetry (Raw) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Natural Standing** | 28.0° |0°| 0.0° |
| **Trial 1 (Start/End)** | 1.0° / 21.0° |27°| 4.1 / 0.0 |
| **Trial 2 (Start/End)** | 11.0° / 29.0° |17°| 2.0 / 0.0 |
| **Trial 3 (Start/End)** | -26.0° / 33.0° |54°| 5.8 / 0.0 |


### 3. Visual Evidence & Frame Analysis

The images below represent the specific frames used for Kinovea validation. These frames confirm that while the sensor output required scaling, the **Relative Lumbar Flexion** detection correctly identified the *direction* and *timing* of every movement.

## Usage Instructions

### Hardware Setup
1. **Initial Calibration**: Power on the device and remain perfectly still in an upright standing position for approximately 20 seconds. The LED will blink during warmup and stay solid during the 2000-sample bias calibration.
2. **System Placement**: Secure the belt so the Main Control Unit (containing the Pelvis IMU) is positioned at the S1/L5 level (lower back/sacral region). The smaller Thoracic Capsule (Lumbar IMU) should be positioned at the T12/L1 level (mid-back).
3. **Verify Calibration**: After calibration completes, the system will set the upright reference automatically. The LED will turn off when ready.

> **Note on OLED Power Consumption**  
> An OLED display was initially integrated into the system to support **calibration feedback** and **battery status monitoring**. However, experimental evaluation showed that the OLED introduced **significant power consumption**, which substantially reduced the overall system runtime. As a result, the OLED module was **temporarily disabled** in the current system implementation.  
> Future work will focus on identifying **power-efficient alternatives** for system status visualization to preserve battery life.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Sensor Configuration
Both MPU6050 sensors are configured with:
* Gyroscope range: ±500°/s (0x08)
* Accelerometer range: ±8g (0x10)
* Digital Low Pass Filter: 20Hz bandwidth (0x04)
* I²C clock frequency: 400kHz

### Calibration Process
The system performs a 2000-sample gyroscope bias calibration at startup to eliminate zero-rate drift. The bias is computed as:
```
b_g = (1/N) × Σ(ω_raw,i)
```

where N=2000 samples taken while stationary. During operation, corrected angular velocity is:
```
 ω_cal = ω_raw - b_g
 ```

### Orientation Estimation
A complementary filter fuses gyroscope and accelerometer data. The error term is computed as the cross product between normalized acceleration and estimated gravity direction, then fed back with gain β=0.03:
```
e = â × g_est
ω_final = ω_cal - βe
```
### SHOE Detection Algorithm
The Zero-Velocity detector computes a test statistic over a 5-sample sliding window:
```
T_n = (1/W) × Σ[(1/σ_a²)||a_k - g·u_n||² + (1/σ_w²)||ω_k||²]

When T_n < threshold (50.0), the system is deemed stationary and ZUPT is applied.
```

### Data Transmission Format
Encrypted BLE packets contain comma-separated values:
```
pitchP,rollP,yawP,pitchL,rollL,yawL,relativeAngle,Zone|Case
```
Example: `15.2,-2.3,0.1,28.4,-2.1,0.2,13.2,YELLOW|FLEXION`

## Future Work

Future work for this system will focus on advancing longitudinal biomechanical assessment and closed-loop feedback evaluation. Planned developments include:

- **Flexion Trend Analysis Over Time**  
  Quantitative tracking of relative lumbar flexion across sessions to analyze long-term changes in movement patterns, variability, and peak flexion exposure during resistance training.

- **Haptic Feedback Effectiveness Assessment**  
  Evaluation of the user’s biomechanical response to haptic cueing by measuring correction latency, flexion reduction magnitude, and post-feedback posture stability.

- **Adaptive Feedback Personalization**  
  Dynamic tuning of feedback thresholds and vibration patterns based on the user’s historical response to haptic cues and observed learning rate.

- **Exercise-Specific Biomechanical Context**  
  Incorporation of exercise-aware models (e.g., deadlift vs squat) to interpret flexion trends relative to task-specific biomechanical demands.

- **Motor Learning and Adaptation Analysis**  
  Investigation of motor learning effects by assessing whether repeated haptic feedback leads to sustained reductions in unsafe lumbar flexion without continuous cueing.

- **Longitudinal Risk Profiling**  
  Aggregation of flexion-related metrics over time to estimate cumulative exposure to potentially hazardous lumbar postures.

- **Extended Experimental Validation**  
  Larger-scale validation studies to correlate flexion trend improvements and feedback responsiveness with indicators of reduced injury risk.

These developments aim to evolve the system from real-time posture correction into a longitudinal biomechanical assessment tool for injury prevention.

## Conclusion

This work presented the **Dual-IMU Smart Trainer** system for real-time lumbar posture monitoring and correction during resistance training, addressing a critical limitation of single-sensor systems that fail to distinguish healthy hip hinge motion from harmful lumbar flexion. By employing a **differential sensing architecture**, the system successfully isolated relative lumbar motion through quaternion-based kinematics, enabling accurate detection of flexion and extension independent of global trunk inclination.

The integration of **robust orientation filtering**, **SHOE-based Zero-Velocity Updates (ZUPT)**, and an **upright reference calibration** ensured stable consistent measurements with minimal drift, even during repetitive dynamic movements. Experimental validation using **Kinovea-based video analysis** confirmed that, despite an initial scaling issue later identified and addressed, the system reliably captured the **direction, timing, and repeatability** of lumbar flexion events. The consistent return to a zero reference after each repetition further validated the effectiveness of the drift-mitigation strategy.

By combining accurate biomechanical sensing with an intuitive **three-zone haptic feedback system**, the proposed trainer provides immediate, coach-like tactile cues that promote safer lifting mechanics without restricting natural movement. Overall, this project demonstrates the feasibility of a low-cost, wearable, and secure platform for real-time lumbar posture correction and establishes a strong foundation for future longitudinal biomechanical assessment and injury prevention research.
