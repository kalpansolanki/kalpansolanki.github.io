A bio-inspired butterfly that combines autonomous motion and simple human interaction to explore the role of IoT in therapeutic companionship.

## Acknowledgements

We sincerely thank the MYOSA team for providing the platform and resources that made this project possible. The MYOSA IoT ecosystem was crucial for experimenting with embedded systems, wireless communication, and sensor integration. 
We also appreciate our faculty mentor for their guidance and feedback during the ideation and development phases. 
Lastly, we recognize the collaborative efforts of all team members. Their contributions in design, implementation, and testing were essential for this project.

## Overview

The Smart Bionic Butterfly is a robotic system that uses IoT technology and takes inspiration from biology. It is designed for gentle, controlled motion and interactive behavior for therapeutic and assistive purposes. The project highlights smooth wing movement, reliable system behavior, and clear feedback, making it ideal for calming and engaging human interaction.

The system features a two-node setup. The butterfly unit has a MYOSA motherboard based on the ESP32. This component runs the main control logic. Once the program is uploaded and the system is turned on, the butterfly executes controlled wing movements based on set command sequences. This primary function does not rely on user gestures and ensures consistent and repeatable performance.

A separate base station unit, also built on the ESP32, allows for optional human interaction and system monitoring. This unit includes a gesture sensor and an OLED display. Simple left and right hand gestures detected at the base station can be sent wirelessly to the butterfly unit as extra directional commands.

The base station and the butterfly communicate using the ESP-NOW protocol. This method permits fast data exchange without needing a Wi-Fi network. The butterfly unit processes incoming gesture inputs carefully.

The system includes onboard motion sensing and environmental awareness through a gyroscope and a pressure sensor attached to the butterfly. Key system states and sensor readings appear on the OLED display of the base station, offering clarity during operation. This design shows how distributed IoT systems can be used for bio-inspired and therapeutic robotic applications, expanding beyond traditional industrial uses.

## Features 

1. Command-Based Wing Motion Control

The butterfly operates based on control commands programmed into the MYOSA motherboard mounted on it. After uploading the firmware and powering on the system, the control logic executes these commands to create continuous and predictable wing movement.

Two mini digital coreless servo motors drive the wings. Each servo controls one wing independently, which allows for symmetric and coordinated motion. Motion parameters like angle range and speed are limited in software to ensure smooth transitions and gentle behavior that is safe for close human interaction.

This command-based method is essential for the system’s behavior. It guarantees stable, repeatable, and safe operation without relying on external inputs.

2. Gesture-Assisted Directional Interaction

The system supports gesture-assisted interaction through a dedicated base station unit. Simple left and right hand gestures detected by the gesture sensor are used to introduce directional influence to the butterfly’s motion.

Gesture input enhances user engagement by allowing intuitive interaction without requiring physical contact. When a gesture is detected, the corresponding directional information is transmitted wirelessly to the butterfly unit, where it is smoothly integrated into the ongoing command-based motion.

This interaction model allows users to gently guide the butterfly’s behavior while preserving stable and predictable operation, making it suitable for therapeutic and assistive environments.
This simple gesture system allows for easy interaction without sudden or overwhelming responses.

3. Wireless Communication Using ESP-NOW

The system uses a dual-ESP setup with the ESP-NOW communication protocol. One ESP32-based MYOSA board is on the butterfly, and a second ESP32-based unit acts as a base station for interaction and monitoring.

ESP-NOW allows quick, direct communication between the two ESP devices without needing a Wi-Fi network or external infrastructure. The base station sends simple directional influence data to the butterfly unit, which interprets this information in a limited and controlled way.

This approach to communication provides responsive interaction while keeping the system simple and reliable.

4. Orientation Monitoring Using Gyroscope

An MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope module is attached to the butterfly to track its orientation and movement. Gyroscope data monitors tilt and position changes during wing motion and directional adjustments.

By continuously checking its orientation, the system avoids excessive deviation and helps ensure smooth and controlled movement. The orientation information is also displayed at the base station, which makes the system more transparent during demonstrations.

5. Environmental Awareness Through Pressure Sensing

A barometric pressure sensor gives the system environmental awareness. The butterfly continuously samples atmospheric pressure data and transmits this for display.

This data is not used for flight or altitude control. Instead, it shows real-time environmental sensing as part of the IoT functionality of the project and helps the system reflect its surroundings.

6. Real-Time System Feedback via OLED Display

An OLED display is built into the base station unit to show real-time system information. The data displayed includes orientation status, pressure readings, and operational indicators.

Providing visible feedback helps caregivers, therapists, and observers understand the internal state of the system during operation. This enhances usability, trust, and clarity during live demonstrations.

7. Lightweight Battery-Based Power System

The Smart Bionic Butterfly runs on lightweight 3.7V lithium-phosphate batteries. Two batteries provide stable power while keeping the overall weight low. This choice helps with smooth servo operation and reliable sensor performance without adding too much mass to the structure.

Using onboard battery power lets the butterfly work independently of external wired supplies during demonstrations. The lightweight batteries fit with the bio-inspired design goals and support future plans for untethered operation.

The battery-powered setup will be shown in the project video to emphasize the system’s portability and readiness for standalone use.
