## Overview

MYOPET is an interactive learning robot designed as a smart learning companion for children. The project focuses on introducing early learning concepts along with basic science and technology in a simple, engaging, and hands-on manner. By interacting with MYOPET, children are exposed to ideas such as motion, system response, and cause-and-effect, helping to build curiosity and interest in learning beyond traditional screen-based methods.

The robot is built using the MYOSA motherboard and integrates multiple sensors for real-time interaction, including gesture, motion, color, and temperature sensing. MYOPET supports various learning modes such as alphabet learning, color recognition, poems, stories, emotion-based interaction, and temperature awareness. Learning feedback is provided through an OLED display and audio output, combining visual and auditory learning in an intuitive way.

Designed with a low-cost and sustainable approach, MYOPET demonstrates that effective and meaningful educational technology can be developed using simple materials while delivering an interactive and engaging learning experience.

**Key features:**
* Multi-mode interactive learning covering alphabets, colors, poems, stories, emotions, and basic science concepts  
* Multi-sensor based interaction using gesture, motion, color, and temperature sensing for hands-on learning  
* Real-time audio-visual feedback through OLED display, speaker, and buzzer to support visual and auditory learning  
* Low-cost and sustainable design utilizing reused electronic waste components, reducing material waste and cost  
* Portable, child-friendly, and distraction-free learning experience designed for safe and engaging early education

## Features

MYOPET is designed with multiple hardware and software features that work together to create an interactive and engaging learning experience for children. Each feature is described in detail below.

---

### **1. Power Control and System Startup**

MYOPET includes a dedicated ON/OFF switch that controls the power supply of the system. When powered ON, the robot initializes all connected sensors and output devices. During startup, the OLED display shows the “MYOSA” logo, and a welcome audio message is played through the speaker, indicating that the system is active and ready for interaction. This simple power control makes the device easy, safe, and child-friendly to use.

</p>

---

### **2. Alphabet Learning Mode**

In Alphabet Mode, MYOPET helps children learn alphabets from A to Z using gesture-based interaction. The APDS9960 gesture sensor detects slow hand movements, allowing children to move forward through the alphabet sequence. Each alphabet is displayed clearly on the SSD1306 OLED screen and spoken aloud through the speaker, enabling both visual and auditory learning. This mode encourages active participation and improves letter recognition.

</p>

### **3. Color Detection and Audio Learning Mode**

In Color Detection Mode, MYOPET uses the APDS9960 sensor to identify RGB colors. When a color is detected, the corresponding color name is displayed on the OLED screen and announced through the speaker. Additionally, each color triggers a specific audio-based learning activity:
- **Red color** plays a poem (“Johnny Johnny Yes Papa”)
- **Blue color** plays a poem (“Twinkle Twinkle Little Star”)
- **Green color** plays a short story  

This mode combines color recognition with storytelling and poems, making learning enjoyable and interactive.

### **4. Emotion Learning Mode Using Motion Sensing**

MYOPET includes an Emotion Learning Mode that uses the MPU6050 gyroscope sensor to detect motion and orientation. Based on the detected movement, the robot displays different emoji expressions on the OLED screen along with matching audio responses. This feature helps children understand basic emotions in a friendly and intuitive way through physical interaction.

### **5. Temperature Awareness and Safety Mode**

The Temperature Mode uses the MYOSA BMP180 sensor to measure the real-time ambient temperature. The current temperature is displayed on the OLED screen. If the temperature exceeds **35 °C**, an alert symbol is shown on the display and the buzzer is activated. This feature introduces children to basic environmental awareness and safety concepts in a simple and practical manner.

### **6. Mode Selection Using Dedicated Button**

MYOPET features a mode selection button located on the left shoulder of the robot. Each press cycles the system through different learning modes in the following order:
```
- Alphabet Mode  
- Color Detection Mode  
- Emotion Mode  
- Temperature Mode  
```
Every mode change is clearly indicated on the OLED display, ensuring that children understand which activity is currently active.

### **7. Reset Functionality**

A dedicated reset button is provided to restart the MYOPET system whenever required. Pressing this button resets all active modes and reinitializes the system, returning it to the startup state. This feature ensures reliable operation during repeated use.

---

### **8. Audio-Visual Output System**

MYOPET delivers feedback through a combination of visual and audio outputs. The SSD1306 OLED display provides clear text, symbols, and emojis, while the speaker plays stored audio files from the micro SD card. A buzzer is used for alerts and notifications. This multi-sensory output system enhances learning by engaging multiple senses simultaneously.
