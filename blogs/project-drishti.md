We thank IEEE, the MYOSA initiative, and Prof. Digant Parmar from Silver Oak University for their guidance and mentorship throughout the development of this project.

## Overview

Project Drishti is an intelligent IoT device designed to monitor crowd conditions in real-time and prevent dangerous situations like stampedes. The system combines multiple environmental sensors with AI-powered analysis to assess crowd risk levels and provide immediate alerts to safety personnel.

The device addresses the critical need for proactive crowd safety management in public spaces, events, and transportation hubs. By continuously monitoring vibration patterns, pressure changes, proximity data, and temperature variations, the CMU can detect early signs of crowd distress and overcrowding before they escalate into dangerous situations.

The system operates in two modes: LIVE mode for real-world deployment and DEMO mode for testing and presentations. It features automatic sensor calibration, wireless connectivity via WiFi and MQTT, and an integrated display for local status monitoring.

## Features (Detailed)

### Multi-Sensor Data Fusion
Project Drishti integrates three primary sensors to create a comprehensive crowd monitoring solution. The MPU6050 accelerometer detects ground vibrations caused by crowd movement, the BMP085 pressure sensor monitors atmospheric pressure changes in enclosed spaces, and the APDS9960 proximity sensor measures local crowd density. All sensor data is processed through advanced filtering algorithms to eliminate noise and provide accurate readings.

### AI-Enhanced Risk Assessment
The system incorporates artificial intelligence algorithms that analyze sensor patterns and historical data to predict crowd risk levels. The AI component calculates crowd count estimates, density measurements, and provides risk classifications (SAFE, CAUTION, WARNING, CRITICAL) based on learned crowd behavior patterns. This enables proactive intervention before dangerous conditions develop.

### Real-Time Communication and Alerts
Built-in WiFi connectivity enables the CMU to communicate with central monitoring systems via MQTT protocol. The device publishes real-time status updates, sensor readings, and risk assessments every 2 seconds. Critical alerts trigger immediate notifications to safety personnel, while an integrated buzzer provides local audio warnings when dangerous conditions are detected.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**: Power on the device and wait for the "MYOSA Initializing..." message on the OLED display
2. **Calibration**: The system automatically calibrates sensors during startup - keep the device still during this process
3. **Network Connection**: Ensure WiFi credentials are configured in the firmware before deployment
4. **Deployment**: Mount the device in the monitoring area at approximately 1.5m height for optimal sensor performance
5. **Monitoring**: Use the MQTT dashboard to monitor multiple devices and receive real-time alerts
6. **Manual Override**: Send MQTT commands to switch between LIVE and DEMO modes or manually set status levels

MQTT Command Examples:
```json
{"command": "MODE", "value": "LIVE"}
{"command": "SET_STATUS", "status": "WARNING"}
{"command": "AI_UPDATE", "ai_crowd_count": 150, "ai_density": 0.75, "combined_risk": "HIGH"}
```
